# character_generator

A character-by-character text generator using an recurrent neural network (RNN).

The network architecture starts with an embedding layer. Then a user-defined number of (LSTM + Batch Norm + Dropout) layers. Finally, there's a fully-connected layer + softmax over the labels.

For text generation, there's a temperature option to allow a trade-off between sampling the character probability distribution and choosing the most likely character. It also uses a beam search for better text generation.

# Fun Examples

These examples come from a network with three LSTM layers with 256 units each, embedding size of 10, and 0.5 dropout.

# How to Run

First install tensorflow, keras, and argh.

Then preprocess the data. It's going to save a numpy array of the characters and a mapping between characters and ids:
```
./model.py initialize ~/Data/text/jane_austen/concat_jane_austen.txt  -d ~/Data/text/jane_austen/chars/text_data.npy -i ~/Data/text/jane_austen/chars/text_ids.json
```

Train the model. There are lots of options for the network architecture. If you have a GPU and CUDNN, then use the "--use-cudnn" option. It will be much faster.
```
./model.py train --epoch 70 -b 128  --use-cudnn -n 3 -r 256 --embedding-size 10 --dropout 0.5 -s 10 ~/Data/text/jane_austen/chars/text_data.npy ~/Data/text/jane_austen/chars/text_ids.json jane_austen_char_0
```

Generate some text!
```
./model.py generate-text ~/Data/text/jane_austen/chars/text_ids.json jane_austen_char_0 --use-cudnn --temperature 0.2 --embedding-size 10 --rnn-size 256 --num-layers 3 --start-text "The "
```

# TODO

* ~~Have a flag to use words, rather than characters.~~
* Support variable-length sequences. This may mean giving up the fast CuDNNLSTM.
* ~~Use a beam search for text generation.~~
* Incorporate with tests and refactor to make the code nicer.
* Have the model dump a history of the mini-batch loss and accuracy.
* Allow training from multiple sources. For example, multiple authors could be used for training all at once. It could then generate text from any particular one of them. This would save on overall training time and allow the model to learn even from relatively small datasets for a particular author.
